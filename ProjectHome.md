## About ##
Scripts and codings not big enough to live in their own projects.

All repositories are versioned with [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) - the coolest distributed VCS out there.

## Available Repositories ##
  * Stuff for [CMS Made Simple](http://cmsmadesimple.org/) ([Browse Repo](http://code.google.com/p/mycodedump/source/browse/?repo=cmsms))
  * Handy shell (bash) scripts for this and that ([Browse Repo](http://code.google.com/p/mycodedump/source/browse/?repo=shellscripts))

## Feedback appreciated! ##
Any feedback to my codings is very much appreciated. Just go ahead and open an [issue](http://code.google.com/p/mycodedump/issues/list).

If you'd like to add improvements (there's plenty of room for that!), let me know and I'll add you as a committer. But of course it's just a matter of
```
 hg clone https://cmsms.mycodedump.googlecode.com/hg/ mycodedump-cmsms
```
to hack your own versions based on what's here. Have fun!
